# nvim-hs-contrib

This Haskell library is intended to be used in conjunction with
[nvim-hs](https://github.com/neovimhaskell/nvim-hs). It should contain
modules that provide generally useful functionality for interacting with
neovim or nvim-hs. This project is kept a little separate from nvim-hs for
practical reasons (mainly compilation times). It should also be a place for
useful smaller plugins that do not add to many dependencies to this
library.
